# Data-Science-From-Scratch
I am learning data science from scratch using the book called: "Data Science from Scratch First Principles with Python, Joel Grus". 
You can find the book here if you want: http://math.ecnu.edu.cn/~lfzhou/seminar/[Joel_Grus]_Data_Science_from_Scratch_First_Princ.pdf
This all is for practice, I hope it helps others as well.
